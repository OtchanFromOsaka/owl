# Codename: Owl - Requirements Document

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for building a page in Cloudflare Workers that showcases a YouTube feed showing bird nests.

## Project Name

**Codename: Owl**

## Functional Requirements

### Home Page (/)

1. **Page Title**
    - The page title should be "Codename: Owl"
    - The title should be prominently displayed at the top of the page

2. **YouTube Feed**
    - The page should display a feed of YouTube videos showing bird nests
    - Videos should be displayed as thumbnails in a grid or list layout
    - Each thumbnail should include:
        - Video thumbnail image
        - Video title
        - Channel name (optional)
        - View count (optional)
        - Upload date (optional)

3. **Recommended Videos**
    - Multiple thumbnails should be displayed as recommended deliveries
    - Thumbnails should be arranged in a visually appealing layout
    - The layout should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes

### Video Interaction

1. **Thumbnail Clicking**
    - When a user clicks on a thumbnail, they should be directed to the YouTube video
    - The video could either:
        - Open in a new tab directly on YouTube, or
        - Play embedded on the page (optional enhancement)

## Technical Requirements

1. **Platform**
    - The application must be deployed to Cloudflare Workers
    - Use the existing HonoX + hono/jsx + TypeScript stack

2. **YouTube Data**
    - Fetch YouTube video data related to bird nests
    - Options for implementation:
        - Use YouTube Data API (requires API key)
        - Use a static JSON file with predefined video data
        - Use server-side fetching to avoid exposing API keys

3. **Responsive Design**
    - The page should work well on desktop and mobile devices
    - Layout should adapt to different screen sizes

4. **Performance**
    - The page should load quickly
    - Optimize image loading for thumbnails
    - Consider lazy loading for thumbnails below the fold

## Design Guidelines

1. **Theme**
    - Use a clean, nature-inspired design that complements the bird nest content
    - Consider using earthy tones and natural colors

2. **Layout**
    - Clear visual hierarchy with the title at the top
    - Organized grid or list of thumbnails
    - Adequate spacing between elements for readability

## Development Approach

1. Follow the existing project structure
2. Create necessary components in the islands directory for interactive elements
3. Implement the main page in the routes directory
4. Follow functional programming principles as per project guidelines
5. Write unit tests for all pure functions
6. Ensure code passes Biome linting and formatting

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. Video filtering by bird species
2. Search functionality
3. Pagination or infinite scrolling for more videos
4. User accounts to save favorite videos
5. Dark/light mode toggle

## Testing Requirements

1. Unit tests for all pure functions
2. E2E tests for critical user flows
3. Responsive design testing across different devices
